#write a function that takes in two strings and returns the minimum number of edit operatiosnt hat need to be preformed on the first string to obtain the second string

#There are three edit operations: insertions of a character, deletion of a character, and substitution of a character for another

#sample input: str1 = "abc", str2 = "yabd"
#output: 2 // insert "y"; substitute "c" for "d"
